### Why

I want to learn React and AWS. I stumbled onto 'Serverless' and decided to give it a go, then decided I've been meaning to learn React too so.

### What I've Learned

* Serverless handles deploying Cloud storage and thats fine by me
* Websocket and broadcasting in general is a lot of fun tbh
* Coming from Angular (and it's CLI) to React was annoying because I made everything by hand (how lazy am I?). Actually, it helped with learning a lot more than waving the magic ng-wand
* I really enjoy the idea of Lambdas, and DynamoDB is very fast, but it's not good for everything...
